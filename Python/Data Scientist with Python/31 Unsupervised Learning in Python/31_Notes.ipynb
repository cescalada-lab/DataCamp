For instance, finding the natural \"clusters\" of customers based on their purchase histories, or searching for patterns and correlations among these purchases, and using these patterns to express the data in a compressed form. These are examples of unsupervised learning techniques called \"clustering\" and \"dimension reduction\".\n",

In this case, the pattern discovery is guided, or \"supervised\", so that the patterns are as useful as possible for predicting the label: benign or cancerous. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, is learning without labels. It is pure pattern discovery, unguided by a prediction task. You'll start by learning about clustering. But before we begin, let's introduce a dataset and fix some terminology.\n",

This fits the model to the data, by locating and remembering the regions where the different clusters occur. Then we can use the predict method of the model on these same samples. This returns a cluster label for each sample, indicating to which cluster a sample belongs. Let's assign the result to labels, and print it out.\n",

You can find the precise definition in the scikit-learn documentation. We want clusters that are not spread out, so lower values of the inertia are better. The inertia of a kmeans model is measured automatically when any of the fit methods are called, and is available afterwards as the inertia attribute. In fact, kmeans aims to place the clusters in a way that minimizes the inertia.\n",

        "10. How many clusters to choose?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this is a trade-off. A good clustering has tight clusters (meaning low inertia). But it also doesn't have too many clusters. A good rule of thumb is to choose an elbow in the inertia plot, that is, a point where the inertia begins to decrease more slowly. For example, by this criterion, 3 is a good number of clusters for the iris dataset."

However, the most important function of dimension reduction is to reduce a dataset to its \"bare bones\", discarding noisy features that cause big problems for supervised learning tasks like regression and classification. In many real-world applications, it's dimension reduction that makes prediction possible.\n",

So if 10% of the words in the document are \"datacamp\", then the tf of \"datacamp\" for that document is point-1. \"idf\" is a weighting scheme that reduces the influence of frequent words like \"the\".\n",

        "For this reason, when comparing two documents, it's a good idea to compare these lines. We'll compare them using what is known as the cosine similarity, which uses the angle between the two lines. Higher values indicate greater similarity. The technical definition of the cosine similarity is out the scope of this course, but we've already gained an intuition.\n",

        "Let's see now how to compute the cosine similarity. Firstly, import the normalize function, and apply it to the array of all NMF features. Now select the row corresponding to the current article, and pass it to the dot method of the array of all normalized features. This results in the cosine similarities.\n",

        "With the help of a pandas DataFrame, we can label the similarities with the article titles. Start by importing pandas. After normalizing the NMF features, create a DataFrame whose rows are the normalized features, using the titles as an index. Now use the loc method of the DataFrame to select the normalized feature values for the current article, using its title 'Dog bites man'. Calculate the cosine similarities using the dot method of the DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, use the nlargest method of the resulting pandas Series to find the articles with the highest cosine similarity. We see that all of them are concerned with 'domestic animals' and/or 'danger'!"
