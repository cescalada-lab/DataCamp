    "You will now make use of what you've learned from this chapter to solve a simple data extraction problem. You will also be introduced to a data structure, the pandas Series, in this exercise. We won't elaborate on it much here, but what you should know is that it is a data structure that you will be working with a lot of times when analyzing data from pandas DataFrames. You can think of DataFrame columns as single-dimension arrays called Series.\n",

Each row is a string that represents a timestamp, and you will access the 12th to 19th characters in the string to extract the time. Use entry as the iterator variable and assign the result to tweet_clock_time. Remember that Python uses 0-based indexing!"
