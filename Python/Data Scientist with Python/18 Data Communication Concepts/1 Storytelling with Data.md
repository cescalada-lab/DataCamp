# Fundamentals of storytelling

6. Data storytelling road

In any communication strategy, there are several pieces we have to put together to create an effective story.

7. Why are stories needed?

But why are stories needed in the first place? People working with data spend a lot of time collecting and processing data, and modeling and evaluating results.

8. Why are stories needed?

But what about communicating insights? Even the best results could fail to have an impact if the insights are not presented appropriately. One of the main challenges is to convince change-adverse stakeholders that some things should be done differently, especially if these stakeholders are non-technical, and do not feel comfortable with math or statistics.

9. What is data storytelling?

That's why telling stories with data is paramount. So what's data storytelling? It's a powerful mechanism for sharing insights supported by a compelling narrative and efficient visualizations. Why is it so powerful? Anecdotes drive people's imagination and and stories are more memorable than metrics, and they add value by giving context to the data. Thanks to that, the audience can understand the insights. So their attention is captured. Those insights facilitate the decision-making process and in, turn, drive actions and changes.

10. Data storytelling

Let's start with building an effective data story. Two concepts help us build its core. The first concept, the three-minute story, makes us think: if we only had three minutes to tell a story, what would we focus on? The second concept, the big idea, pushes us to state our story's unique point of view in one sentence. These concepts help us articulate our story clearly and concisely.

11. Data storytelling

There are three central elements for any data story: the data, the narrative and the visuals. These elements make the story insightful, as it derives clear learnings from our analysis, explanatory, because we help our audience understand your insights, and concise, giving only concrete and specific facts.

12. Data

To build an effective story, we should include only findings from our models or analysis that apply to the situation. Our story should be based on accurate and reliable data, leaving out all untrustworthy results. Most importantly, our story should always include actionable insights: data that drives action.

13. Narrative

A good data story includes a compelling and easy to understand narrative that includes only the key points needed to drive change.

14. Narrative

Even though it is tempting to include many disconnected facts, a compelling narrative revolves around one central insight, that takes into account the background and our intended audience so it can clarify the facts for them. Who are they? What do they need to know? Lastly, every data story follows a linear sequence. So every data point builds on each other until the conclusion is reached.

15. Visuals

However, we should be careful to not include misleading graphs.

## The story begins
You recently started working as a data scientist at a company named Communicatb. For your first project, you and your team need to analyze churn customer data for a cell phone company. The goal is to predict their behavior and help develop a program to retain customers.

Your team lead knows you are an expert on storytelling. She asks you to explain to the team why crafting a compelling story is important when delivering results. You write down a list of reasons to be prepared.

One of the statements you wrote is false. Can you select which one is it?

### True:
* It will be easier for the audience to remember an anecdote on why customers churn than the correlation coefficients between customer traits.
* Your findings will be better aligned with change-adverse stakeholder expectations. They will be most likely to implement the program to retain customers.
* The marketing team will have a better understanding of the impact of your model. It is central since they are creating the retention program.

````
If you are looking to drive change and facilitate decision-making, stories can help you persuade the audience of the data story.
Telling a story can add value by giving context so that non-technical stakeholders can understand the insights.
Statistics are an important part of your story base, but anecdotes are more memorable than numbers.
````

### False:
* Even if your data do not reveal a distinct customer behavior, storytelling might influence stakeholders to create the retention program.

``Correct! Data is the foundation of your story. So you need to make sure you are telling a story based on reliable and accurate results!``

## Building a story
You nailed it! Your explanation of why stories are efficient when conveying insights went very well! Now, your team lead would like you to give a short presentation. You're going explain the different steps involved in telling a story with data to the team. It will be the starting point for delivering the results of the churn project when ready.

You know it is an important task. To prepare your talk, you look for your notes on the storytelling course you took, but realize that some parts are erased. So you need to remember the do's and dont's of data storytelling.

Which of the following statements about effective data storytelling are true, and which are false?

### TRUE:
* To create a compelling narrative,connect the most important fondings to actions of the retention program.
* Present one supporting customer data point after each other so they naturally reach a conclusion.
* To drive change, centre your story around how the company's profit will increase if the retentionprogram is implemented.

# Translating technical results

3. Tech or non-tech approach?

Now that we learned why designing a story is important, we should look into the next piece: defining how technical our audience is. We will simplify this into technical and non-technical for better understanding, but technical knowledge is a continuum and it's up to you to assess your audience's technical proficiency - the Director of Analytics is likely more technical than the People Ops Generalist. In general, data professionals like to talk about their methods. Less technical audiences however typically just care about what the result is and what the implications are.

4. How technical?

For example, we may need to explain why low accuracy predictions affect the business outcome to supply chain specialists and how better data entry on their end could help. They won't care about our model or hyper-parameter tuning. They will care that if data entry is improved and taken seriously, predictions will be improved they will have to deal with a lot less returns and shipping problems.

5. Translating technical results into stories

This requires translating results into easy to understand stories that can engage a non-technical audience. Stakeholders will understand our results, telling stories with simple terms can facilitate decision-making processes and, eventually, drive change. There are different strategies to communicate our insights and results effectively. Let's explore them.

6. Awareness

The first thing is considering our audience. What is their background? What do they know? Understanding our audience help us adjust our story content to each stakeholder. So instead of explaining how our model works, they should understand the impact and limitations of our predictions. How much do they need to understand to meet our goal? We should explain the results with enthusiasm and be aware of any questions they have. Explaining why we chose the variables to predict is not useful for a non-tech person, we should explain the context in which our model works. What information do they need? Our story should help the audience understand what our project is about. Listing the correlation coefficients could be overwhelming, it's better to explain the interaction between customer traits.

7. ADEPT

The ADEPT technique, as recommended by Kalid Azad, can be pretty handy. We need to use analogies, so the audience can relate new things they are not very comfortable with to other things they understand well already. We also need diagrams, to help visualize. The illustrative power of examples is always efficient.

8. Analogies

As an example, instead of explaining how a neural network works with forward and backward propagation, we can say it learns like a child does, by getting feedback on what is right or wrong, what works and what doesn't.

9. Technical jargon

We also need to pay attention to our choice of word. Acronyms, for example, should be used with caution. They help communication if everyone understands them, but hurt it otherwise otherwise. At Space X for example, acronyms have to be approved by Musk. It's good practice to introduce an acronym's meaning the first time it's used. Similarly, we should limit the use of jargon. and instead translate the terminology into simpler and familiar terms. Including a reference guide or definitions in our report is good practice as well. Again, we should take our audience into account: the data manager might now what EDA means, but the HR specialist might not.

10. Focus on impact

Even if we are interested in showing the technical details, a persuasive story usually focuses on impact rather than process. If we are talking about adopting new technology, we should focus on the impact that technology has on the technical team's time and deliverables. Or if we are explaining how our model predicts an outcome, we should focus on the benefits, such as financial benefits.

11. Humility

Lastly, we should be aware that not all technical details can be removed. In that case, we should make our audience comfortable demonstrating receptiveness to questions, proactively asking if it's clear or if there are any questions after an explanation, and be prepared to explaining concepts again using different strategies.

# Impacting the decision-making process

1. Impacting the decision-making process

Well done! We've discussed data storytelling and translating results for non-technical stakeholders.

2. Data storytelling

Particularly, we mentioned that a strong data story has three elements: the data, the narrative, and the visuals.

3. Compelling narrative

Let's focus on the narrative. After we've found relevant insights in our data, we have to find a meaningful way to present them to our target audience, using a narrative that includes only key points and helps us drive change. In other words, we need a compelling narrative or a description of connected events that organizes information to engage the audience and make them care for the results or information shared.

4. Narrative structure

This might sound challenging at first, but following a narrative structure will help. There are several narrative structures that are out of the scope of this course, but it all comes down to a structural framework guiding how we present our story. Imagine that as part of the job in communicatb, we are presenting results to a food company. To start our data story, we should mention the background: details about what problem motivated the analysis, what changed in the previous situation that warranted an analysis, and who the analysis is focusing on. Are we analyzing data from customers? From employees? Or something else?. In our case, we mention that opposite to management expectations the company's total profits have decreased in the last three quarters.

5. Narrative structure

After the problem was introduced, we should provide evidence of the factors that contributed to the problem. But we should only include relevant information and not detailed data that can overload the audience. We analyzed the data and found that the chips sales have increased by 20%. However, sweet item sales have declined overall by 30%.

1 Dykes, Brent. Effective Data Storytelling. Wiley.

6. Narrative structure

We can also provide more supporting evidence and data, as long as we help explain on a deeper level the cause of the problem. So after taking a deeper look, we saw that the company's most famous chocolate has seen its sales decreased by 50%.

1 Dykes, Brent. Effective Data Storytelling. Wiley.

7. Narrative structure

All the evidence should lead to the climax: the moment when we introduce the central finding of our analysis. It should provide clear insights on what could happen if nothing is changed. We predicted that if the company does not make a decision, it will lose 10 million dollars next year.

8. Narrative structure

After the main finding is revealed, we should finish exploring potential solutions and opportunities, by recommending a course of action to take. We need to be proactive and guide the audience through understanding what to do with our results if we want to impact the decision making process. So according to our predictions, rebranding the chocolate and offering special discounts can achieve a 20% profit. With these steps, we created a narrative that will catch our audience's interest.

9. Building narrative

Running an analysis, there are several things you might look at, which will in turn drive your narrative. We can explore how a feature changes over time or the time cycle patterns, for example, how chocolate sales are lower in summer but higher in winter. we could focus on how two things are related to each other, for example chocolate price and the customer rating, or display similarities and differences between chocolate consumption between adults and children. Also, we can find groups in the data, such as high chocolate and high coffee consumers vs low chocolate and low coffee consumers. As we craft our narrative, we need to make sure that these data points make a relevant and relatable story.

## Is it a true story?
You have done an amazing job explaining your exploratory data analysis on the churn project. Now, it's time to run the model to predict customer churn. You know that you will have to craft an effective story to present these results.

You want to be prepared. So you read your notes on how to build a compelling narrative. But you realized that one of your notes is not accurate.

Which of the following statement is false?

### TRUE:
* A compelling narrative is key to presenting relevant insights to your target audience in a meaningful and impactful way.
* Because you should shape the narrative to your target audience, showing only key points or findings is a good practice.

````
both strong insights and a compelling narrative are key to impacting your audience decisions.
When crafting your data story, you should only include points relevant to your audience. It will help you engage them and catch their attention.
````

### FALSE:
* Unless you have a great data groundwork to support your central insight, your findings will need a well-formed and compelling narrative to drive action and change.

```A strong compelling narrative is key when telling stories with data. It can make a difference in the decision-making process. But remember that the story should always be based on strong and trustworthy resul```t
